# Balloon Flight is a game where the player clicks on the screen to keep the balloon up
# The balloon must not collide with the bird and house actors
# If the balloon collides with a bird/house or touches the bottom/top of the screen the game is over
# If a new high score is achieved then it is written to the high-scores.txt file and is displayed when the game ends
